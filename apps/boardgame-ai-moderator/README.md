# Boardgame AI Moderator

This is a standalone Vite + React frontend that has been added to the repository as a separate app.

It lives under `apps/boardgame-ai-moderator` so it does not interfere with the existing Python CLI project.

## Run Locally

Prerequisite: Node.js

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. If the app uses Gemini features, set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
4. Build with `npm run build`
