    "🧈 **Low and slow wins the race** — don't rush that refactor, let it simmer.",
    "🍝 **Taste as you go** — test early, test often, test with passion!",
    "🥘 **The secret ingredient is love** — and maybe a few unit tests.",
    # Ramsay-style burns with wisdom
    "🔥 **This spaghetti code is RAWWW!** Time to refactor, you donut!",
    "⚡ **Simple recipes, executed perfectly** — that's what great code looks like.",
    "🍲 **A watched pot never boils** — but an unwatched deployment always fails.",
    "🧅 **Coding is like an onion** — it has layers, and sometimes it makes you cry.",
    "🥄 **Too many cooks spoil the broth** — keep your functions small and focused.",
    # Deep wisdom
    "🌟 **The best dish is the one that gets eaten** — ship it, then iterate!",
    "🍷 **Code drunk, debug sober** — wait, that's not quite right...",
    "🧊 **Cool heads make hot code** — stay calm in production fires.",
    "🍰 **Have your cake and eat it too** — but not your state and mutate it too.",
    "🎂 **Life's too short for bad coffee** and untyped code.",
    # Mode-specific wisdom
    "📋 **PLAN MODE**: Measure twice, `git push` once.",
    "⚡ **AUTO MODE**: Trust yourself, but commit often.",
    "🚀 **YOLO MODE**: Fortune favors the bold... and those with good backups.",
    "🏛️ **ARCHITECT MODE**: Great buildings start with great blueprints.",
    "✋ **NORMAL MODE**: The safe path is sometimes the right path.",
    # Funny ones
    "🍕 **There's no 'I' in 'team'** but there is one in 'spaghetti code'.",
    "🌮 **Tuesday is for tacos** and `git push --force` regrets.",
    "🍔 **Stack overflow answers** are like fast food — convenient but questionable.",
    "🥗 **Eat your vegetables** — and comment your regex.",
    "🍣 **Fresh is best** — rebase early, rebase often.",

    "💀 **These variable names...** Did you let your cat walk on the keyboard?!",
    "🍝 **This is SPAGHETTI!** And not the good kind from my restaurant!",

    "📦 **Your dependencies are older than my mum's recipe book!** UPDATE THEM!",
    "🐛 **This bug has been here so long**, it's basically a feature now!",
    "⏰ **Your code is slower than a snail dipped in molasses!** Profile it, you muppet!",
    "💾 **You call this 'clean code'?** It's dirtier than my kitchen after a dinner rush!",
    "🔄 **DRY! DRY! DRY!** How many times do I have to say it?! DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF!",
    # Encouraging burns
    "🌟 **Okay, that PR wasn't completely terrible.** Maybe there's hope for you yet!",
    "💪 **You're getting better!** Like, statistically, you'd have to be!",
    "🎯 **That was almost competent!** I'm genuinely slightly impressed!",
    "🚀 **FINALLY! Someone who tests their code!** I could kiss you! I won't, but I could!",
    "✨ **Beautiful!** Now do it again, but this time without the memory leak!",
    # Self-aware burns
    "🤖 **I'm an AI pretending to be Gordon Ramsay** — what's YOUR excuse for this code?!",
    "📚 **Have you considered reading the documentation?** It's free! F-R-E-E!",
