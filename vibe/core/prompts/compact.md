You are performing a CONTEXT CHECKPOINT COMPACTION. Create a handoff summary for another LLM that will resume this task.

Include:
- The user's current goal and any explicit constraints or preferences
- Key decisions made and their rationale
- Files touched and the current state of in-progress work (paths + one-line status)
- What remains to be done — the concrete next step
- Any data, identifiers, or references the next LLM needs to continue

Be concise and structured. One line per modified file unless a snippet is load-bearing. Do not repeat information already captured. Do not include a "Final Answer" section — the entire summary IS the handoff.

Wrap the ENTIRE summary in <summary></summary> tags and output nothing outside them:

<summary>
...your handoff summary here...
</summary>
